## Insights:
- The number of Airbnb listings has steadily increased since the platform's launch, with prices also rising initially due to early adopters and growing demand.
- As Airbnb became more widely recognized, listings continued to grow, but prices began to decrease as the market matured.
- Following the introduction of regulations around 2015, confidence in the business decreased, leading to a reduction in listings while prices began to rise again.
- By 2019, as the regulations became the new norm, listings increased once more, and prices continued to decrease due to a higher supply of properties.

## Recommendations:
- **Impact of Regulations**: Long-term rental regulations could negatively affect the business, leading to potential churn among both customers and hosts.
- **Financial Impact**: These regulations may increase AirBnBâ€™s losses, which could be difficult to recover.
- **Brand Perception**: Any negative impact on customer experience could harm AirBnB's brand image.
- **Proactive Monitoring**: AirBnB should monitor regulations in other regions and prepare for potential impacts.
- **Replicating Regulations**: AirBnB can consider applying similar regulations in other regions to ensure consistency.
- **Host Management**: Stricter rules for onboarding and removing hosts could help maintain quality.
- **Limiting Listings**: Restricting the number of AirBnBs in certain areas can balance the market and prevent government intervention.
